 * Does what python's `range` function does, with a slightly different

 * Useful for numbered loops in angular templates, since we can do
 * a normal for loop.
 *

 * @param stop Generate numbers up to, but not including this number
 * @param [start=0] Starting number of the sequence
 * @param [step=1] Difference between each number in the sequence
 * @returns an array with resulting numbers
