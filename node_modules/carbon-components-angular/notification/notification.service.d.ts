     * **Members:**
     *
     * * `type` can be one of `"info"`, `"warning"`, `"danger"`, `"success"`
     * * `message` is message for notification to display
     * * `target` is css selector defining an element to append notification to. If not provided,
     * `showNotification()` creates a place for the notification in `body`
     * * `duration` is number of ms to close the notification after. If used in combination with `smart`,
     * it's added to the calculated timeout
     * * `smart`, set to `true` if you want to use smart notification.
     *
     * **Example:**
     * ```typescript
     * // Info notification, saying "Sample message." added to the element with id notification-container
     * // uses smart timeout with added duration of 1 second.
     * {
     *	type: "info",
     *	message: "Sample message.",
     *	target: "#notification-container",
     *	duration: 1000,
     *	smart: true
     * }
