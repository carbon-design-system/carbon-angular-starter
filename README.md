# CARBON ANGULAR STARTER

Kick start your application development with Carbon Angular.

## Prerequisites

* [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Included with node)
* [git](https://git-scm.com/)

Run the following in the terminal:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-angular-starter.git

# to install
cd carbon-angular-starter
npm i
```

## Development server
Run `npm run start` or `npx ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/). The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## How to use components

Look at the [component library](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/) and [developer documentation](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/documentation/).

## Create new angular components

Run `npx ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `npx ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag (`npm run build -- -prod`) for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `npx ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
